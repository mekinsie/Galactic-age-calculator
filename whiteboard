Planet solar year = number of days(variable)
planetSolarYear = days
yourAge = x

Class that does each of the following:

Class PlanetAge:
mercuryAge: yourAge(0.24)
VenusAge: yourAge(0.62)
MarsAge: yourAge(1.88)]
JupiterAge: yourAge(11.86)

lifeExpectMercury: (73*0.24) - mercuryAge
lifeExpectVenus: (73*0.24) - venusAge
lifeExpectMars: (73*0.24) - mercuryAge
lifeExpectJupiter: (73*0.24) - jupiterAge

general lifeExpect = (lifeExpectancy * planetConvert.planet) - (PlanetAge.planet)

Class: PlanetConvert
mercury = 0.24
Venus = 0.62
Mars = 1.88
Jupiter= 11.86

Determine how many years left 

Average world life expectancy: 73 years. 
Need to determine life expectancy based on demographics. LATER
Activity level


How long you have left to live on earth: 73 - yourAge

already surpassed life expectancy? return nmber of years they lived past life expectancy (use if-then statement if age > life expectancy):
years lived past: (theirAge - lifeExpectancyAge)(planetYearConversion)
